Exercise 5: "Simple Math"

This exercise is built using JavaScript Node.js, with npm inquirer installed. Since we are using Node.js, the I/O will be interactive through the Command Line Interface (CLI). This build is going to ask the user to enter two numbers of their choice. The output will display the sum, difference, product, and quotient of the two input numbers.
