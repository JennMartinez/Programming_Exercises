Exercise 5: "Simple Math"

This exercise is built using JavaScript, using window modals for input and output. Since we are using window modals, the I/O will be interactive through the browser. This build is going to ask the user to enter two numbers of their choice. The output will display the sum, difference, product, and quotient of the two input numbers.
