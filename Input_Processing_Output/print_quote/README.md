Exercise 3: "Printing Quotes"

This exercise is built using JavaScript Node.js, with npm inquirer installed. Since we are using Node.js, the I/O will be interactive through the Command Line Interface (CLI). This build is going to ask two questions, and will output the answers using quotation marks. Escape characters are utilized to accomplish the quotation marks for the output.
