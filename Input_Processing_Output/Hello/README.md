This exercise calls for a program build that displays simple questiona to the user, and then prints out their responses on the screen.

I have utilized the JavaScript language to complete my programming build. The alert, prompt, and confirm functions will be used to interact with the browser, which will display the questions and user's answers in modal windows.
