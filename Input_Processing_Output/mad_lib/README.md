Exercise 4: "Mad Lib"

This exercise is built using JavaScript Node.js, with npm inquirer installed. Since we are using Node.js, the I/O will be interactive through the Command Line Interface (CLI). This build is going to ask the user to enter a noun, verb, adjective, and adverb. The intended output will display the words inputed in a sentence, in a mad lib form.
