This exercise calls for a program build that displays questions for the user to input an answer. The user's response processes and displays as an output on the screen.

I have utilized the JavaScript language to complete my programming build. The alert, prompt, and confirm functions will be used to interact with the browser, which will display the questions and user's answers in modal windows.
